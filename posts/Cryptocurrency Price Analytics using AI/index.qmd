Designed and implemented an artificial neural network (ANN) model using TensorFlow to predict future cryptocurrency prices based on historical price data. Built a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to improve prediction accuracy by considering the temporal nature of cryptocurrency price movements. Built an offline Django website that provides users with a user-friendly interface to access and visualize the predictions made by the ANN and LSTM model.
