Objectives:

• Explore Stamp Registration, Transportation and Ts-Ipass Datasets. Understand their attributes, categories and time period.

• Analyze trends and patterns within each department.

• Identify growth opportunities and areas needing attention.

• Find correlation among these departments and report the overall growth of the state through insights and relevant visuals such as shape maps.

Primary Questions:

**Stamp Registration**

**Driving Factors for slow growth in sales in some months**
**Vehicle registrations in Telangana for the year 2020-04-01 reduced drastically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown imposed by the government in March 2020 restricted the movement of people and vehicles, which led to a decline in the demand for new vehicles. Additionally, the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic also led to people postponing their plans to buy new vehicles.**

**According to the Telangana Transport Department, the number of vehicle registrations in the state fell by 56% in April 2020 compared to the same month in the previous year. The decline was even more pronounced in the following months, with registrations falling by 72% in May 2020 and 80% in June 2020.**

**Here are some other factors that may have contributed to the decline in vehicle registrations in Telangana in 2020:**

**The increase in the prices of vehicles due to the rise in the cost of raw materials. The shortage of semiconductors, which is a key component in many vehicles. The uncertainty about the future of the economy, which made people hesitant to make major purchases such as a new vehicle.**

**There are a few possible reasons why vehicle registrations in Telangana drastically reduced in May 2021.**

**The COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak in India during this time, and many people were staying home to avoid getting sick. This would have led to a decrease in the demand for new vehicles. The Telangana government increased the registration fees for vehicles in April 2021. This would have made it more expensive to buy a new vehicle, which could have also contributed to the decline in registrations. The Indian economy was also struggling during this time, which could have made it difficult for people to afford to buy a new vehicle. It is also possible that there is another factor that caused the decline in vehicle registrations in Telangana in May 2021. However, the reasons mentioned above are the most likely explanations.**

**Here are some additional details about each of the reasons mentioned above:**

**The COVID-19 pandemic caused a nationwide lockdown in India in March 2020. The lockdown was gradually lifted in the following months, but many people were still hesitant to go out and about in public. This would have led to a decrease in the demand for transportation, including new vehicles. The Telangana government increased the registration fees for vehicles in April 2021. The increase was as follows: Three-wheelers: from Rs. 600 to Rs. 2,500 Light motor vehicles: from Rs. 600 to Rs. 5,000 Medium goods vehicles: from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500 Heavy goods vehicles: from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,000 This increase in registration fees would have made it more expensive to buy a new vehicle, which could have contributed to the decline in registrations.**

**The Indian economy was also struggling during this time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate rose, and many businesses were forced to close. This would have made it difficult for people to afford to buy a new vehicle.**

**How does the distribution of vehicles vary by vehicle class (MotorCycle, MotorCar, AutoRickshaw, Agriculture) across different districts? Are there any districts with a predominant preference for a specific vehicle class? Consider FY 2022 for analysis.**

```{python}
#data_fy_2022 = m[m['year'] == 2022][['district', 'vehicleClass_MotorCycle', 'vehicleClass_MotorCar', 'vehicleClass_AutoRickshaw', 'vehicleClass_Agriculture']]
# Group by district and calculate the mean distribution for each vehicle class
#district_vehicle_distribution = data_fy_2022.groupby('district').mean()

**2.What significant policies or initiatives were put into effect to enhance economic growth, investments, and employment in Telangana by the current government? Can we quantify the impact of these policies using available data?**

**Industrial Policy Framework: The Telangana government introduced an industrial policy that aims to promote industrialization and attract investments across various sectors. This policy includes incentives and concessions for industries setting up in the state.**

**TS-iPASS (Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System): TS-iPASS is an initiative to provide speedy and transparent approvals for setting up industries in Telangana. It simplifies the approval process and aims to create a business-friendly environment.**

**T-Hub: T-Hub is a start up incubator and accelerator that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship. It provides a platform for start ups to collaborate, learn, and scale their businesses.**

**Mission Bhagiratha: This project focuses on providing safe drinking water to every household in Telangana. Access to clean water infrastructure can improve health and living conditions, indirectly supporting economic growth.**

**Rythu Bandhu Scheme: This scheme provides financial assistance to farmers in the form of investment support before the crop season. It aims to ensure farmers' economic stability and enhance agricultural productivity.**

**Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC): TSIC promotes innovation and research in various sectors. It supports start ups, provides training, and encourages the development of innovative solutions.**

**These policies helped the investments raising and clearance of industry establishment in the state.**

**As the data of the TS-iPASS shows the steady growth of investments increased especially in the real estate , Pharmaceuticals, solar and renewable energy,etc.**

**3.Provide top 5 Insights & 5 recommendations to Telangana government for sustained growth in the next 5 years based on your analysis.**

5 Insights

1.The investments in the state in constantly increasing

2.Utilization of technology is increasing in every sector

3.The people buying power is constantly increasing

4.Companies are more interested in establishing their companies

5.Investment in R&D is not increasing variably and needs improvement.

Recommendation 1: Support Local Businesses

Promote local entrepreneurship and small businesses by providing incentives, access to capital, and mentor ship programs. Encourage the growth of local industries to ensure that the benefits of increased buying power stay within the state.

Recommendation 2: Ease of Doing Business

Continue to improve the ease of doing business in the state by reducing bureaucratic red tape, simplifying regulations, and streamlining permit processes. Creating a business-friendly environment will attract more companies and foster economic growth.

Recommendation 3: Research and Innovation Hubs

Establish research and innovation hubs in collaboration with academic institutions and industry partners. Provide grants, tax incentives, and resources to encourage research and development across various sectors. Invest in innovation to drive long-term economic growth.

Recommendation 4: Sustainable Agriculture Practices

Promote and subsidize the adoption of sustainable and organic farming practices. Encourage farmers to use organic fertilizers, reduce chemical pesticide use, and implement water-saving techniques. This will enhance food production while safeguarding the environment.

Recommendation 5: Infrastructure Development
