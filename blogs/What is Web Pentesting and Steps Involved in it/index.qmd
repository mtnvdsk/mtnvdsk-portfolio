What is Web Pentesting?

Web pentesting is a process of testing the security of a web application and identifying any vulnerabilities present in the application or not. This testing is done by an attacker perspective to detect the vulnerabilities more easily.

Steps Involved in Web Pentesting

Step 1: Recon

Recon mainly focuses on the gathering information from the web application like technologies used , databases , versions of the technologies and many more.

Step 2: Vulnerability Scanning

Scanning for vulnerabilities is a huge task but to reduce our time there are many tools that can automate the tasks of identifying the vulnerabilities.

Step 3: Manual Testing

Although many automation tools detect vulnerabilities but some need human interaction and manual testing.

Step 4: Exploiting

This step needs to be done if you have authorized permission to do and in this step the identified vulnerabilities needs to be malicious actions to determine the effect of the vulnerability detected.

Step 5: Reporting

Reporting the vulnerability detected helps the organization fix it and reduce their exposure to risk and external threats. The report must include detailed description of the vulnerability , steps to reproduce it and mitigations for it.

Key Points While Conducting Web Application Pentesting

1. Getting authorization : First getting an authorized access and permission to pentest the application is needed because to allow you to perform your attacks easily and report them.

2. Scope : Determine the scope of the application helps you to focus on those targets like URLs, limitations and exceptions, etc.

3. Use legitimate tools: Usage of legitimate tools makes the testing worth it and doesnot allow any third party to get your data while testing. some of the example are OWASP Zap, Burpsuite, Nmap ,etc.

4. Documentation: Documentation and report preparation is the most important part of the pentesting as it helps the organization to check and reiterate it to identify the problem to mitigate it.

5. Keep yourself updates: As the technology evolves new vunerabilities and zero-day attacks increases . so, to keep up with it stay updated.

Tools For Web Pentesting

Burpsuite - It is a proxy tool to get the traffic flow thorugh the tool to see the request made by the browser and response given by the server.
Wappalyzer- It is a extension to detect the technologies present in the web applications.
Web developer - It is a browser extension to detect the links as well as many other end points in the website.
shodan - It is a search engine to gather the information from the internet connected devices.
censys - It works similar to shodan.

Why Web Application P en Tests Are Performed?

The web application pentesting is performed to ensure the integrity ,confidentiality and availability of the resources that the customers or company employees need to complete their tasks. It is most important to protect the end users from malicious attacks which leads to loos of customer data or the organization data which is why it is very crucial to pentest the websites and detect the vulnerabilities.

 Importance of Penetration Testing

The undetected bugs can be detected when conducting the pentesting.
To detect the unwanted methods used in the requests from the browser.
To detect the impact of the bugs detected when pentesting.
Detect how far can a attacker can get in the application.
To identify the weakness of the application.

What are the Different Types of Penetration Testing?

There are mainly 3 types of testing:

1.White box Tesing

It is a type of testing where we have all the access to the source code as well as the developer support to understand indetail of the functionality. This testing is mainly done at the development stage and after completion stage of the application.

2.Blackbox Testing

It is a type of testing where the application details are given but the indetail functionality or the credentials are not given and you should perform the testing as an attacker perspective not as a tester (now you have to become a hacker in this testing) . Here most of the bugs are detected.

3.Grey box Testing

It is a type of testing where the application as well as some walkthrough of the application functionality is provided and rest of the testing needs to be done .


FAQ's On Web Pentesting

Q.1: How to start a web pentesting?

Answer:

First to start a web pentesting we need to be aware of the how the websites works and must have basic understanding of how requests , responses are generated along with some basic knowledge of web technologies.

Q.2: What to do after finding the bugs?

Answer:

If you are a begineer then there are many platforms that offer domains to test and they will reward you if you found any intresting bugs in their domains and these are called as "Bug bounty programs"

Q.3: What are the operating systems used by pentesters?

Answer:

Mostly when it comes to web application pentesting the most used operating system is kali linux, ubuntu,etc. But those who cannot have kali linux as their default os they can use WSL(windows subsystem for linux) in windows.
